The shader pipeline behaves as follows:
	Vertex Shaders -> Geometry Shaders -> (Rasterizing Engine) -> Fragment Shaders.


The vertex shader runs considerably less often than the fragment shader.
Because is executed once for every vertex (which are the corner points of polygons).
It's used to modify or add new information to those vertices.


- Model Space (all vertices defined relatively to the center of the model)
- World Space (all vertices defined relatively to the center of the world).
- Camera/View Space (all vertices defined relatively to the camera).
- Homogeneous Space (all vertices defined in a small cube. Everything inside the cube is onscreen)
