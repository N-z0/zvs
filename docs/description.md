# zVs
**Simple Virtual Space**


## 🚩 Intro
a Python library that we can use to draw and animate 3D worlds.  
*(and hear the sounds of objects)*  


## 📋 Glossary
 - OpenGL  
	is a cross-language,cross-platform API for rendering vector graphics.  
 - OpenAL  
	is a cross-language,cross-platform API for rendering multichannel 3D audio.  
 - Framework  
	( sometimes mistakenly called "engines")
	provides a standard way to build and deploy applications.  
 - low-level language  
	requires more lines of codes, because they dont manage themselves some tasks related to how computers works.  


## ℹ️ Description
There is already many existing graphics libraries.  
But most of them are integrated inside frameworks  
and most of them require to code in low-level language.  
so the aim of this project is to fill this gap  
even if currently not reaching the pretty graphic level of the others.  
Python developers who just want a simple way to display a virtual world should be interested.  
It works with OpenGL for graphics and OpenAL for sounds,  
other python modules are also needed, but few as possible and only the most portable.  


## 📝 Note
 - The modules are written for Python3 and no effort are made for compatibility with Python2.
 - The modules are only tested on Linux O.S. hoping to be able to work on other similar platforms.

## ❤️ Special thanks
I am very grateful for all those people on internet who explain better than official manuals do. Without them i'm not much.
